# Workflow: whenever there is a push to the master branch, and either the code in /frontend or /infrastructure/frontend changes, 
 # terraform init and terraform apply is ran on the infrastruture/frontend folder, which will reupload objects to the 
  # S3 bucket (if objects were modified)

name: Deploy Frontend to S3

# Commented the whole thing out because it seems to be destroying my S3 objects for some reason

# on:
#   push:
#     branches:
#       - master  # Or `main`, depending on your branch name
#     paths:
#       - 'frontend/**'  # Trigger only when files in the frontend folder change
#       - 'infrastructure/frontend/**' # Also trigger if IaC for frontend changes
