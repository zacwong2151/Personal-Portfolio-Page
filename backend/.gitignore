# .terraform directory
# This directory is created by 'terraform init' and contains
# downloaded provider plugins, modules, and other temporary data.
# It can be regenerated by running 'terraform init'.
.terraform/

# Terraform state files
# These files contain the current state of your infrastructure.
# They can include sensitive data (like passwords) in plain text.
# Terraform recommends storing state remotely (e.g., in S3) with state locking.
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup
# If using local workspaces (less common for remote state),
# these might also be created.
.terraform/terraform.tfstate

# Crash log files
# Generated if Terraform encounters a crash.
crash.log
crash.*.log

# Variable definition files
# These often contain sensitive information (API keys, passwords)
# or environment-specific values that should not be committed to Git.
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json
# You might keep an example.tfvars or .tfvars.example without sensitive data.

# Override files
# Used for local overrides during development or testing.
# These should generally not be committed to source control.
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Terraform plan files
# If you run 'terraform plan -out=tfplan_file', these files
# contain the proposed changes and can also contain sensitive data.
*.tfplan
*.plan

# Terraform CLI configuration files
# These are local to your machine.
.terraformrc
terraform.rc

# Terraform dependency lock file
# This file records the exact provider versions used by 'terraform init'.
# While it ensures reproducibility, it's sometimes debated whether to commit it.
# HashiCorp now generally recommends committing it for consistent provider versions.
# If you *do not* want to commit it, uncomment the line below.
# .terraform.lock.hcl

# IDE/Editor specific files (common for many projects, not just Terraform)
.vscode/        # Visual Studio Code settings
.idea/          # IntelliJ IDEA / WebStorm settings
.DS_Store       # macOS specific desktop services store

# Editor backup files (e.g., from vim, emacs)
*~              # Vim backup files
\#*#            # Emacs backup files
